# Data Structures and Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms. These implementations are from the coursework I completed during both my undergraduate  and graduate studies. Most of the code structure is derived from "Introduction to Algorithms" and "Algorithms Illuminated" by Tim Roughgarden, my former professor at Columbia University.

While the implementations may not always be fully optimized or may fail in some edge cases, they are intended primarily for learning purposes.

## Installation

To use the code, simply install the latest version of Python (version 3.x recommended). You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can run the code locally by simply executing Python scripts in the command line.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, use, and adapt the code for your purposes. If any of the implementations are my original ideas and haven't been documented elsewhere, I will include a comment indicating intellectual property.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open a pull request. I am open to any contributions that will help me improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
